# Minimal Java Machine Learning Toolkit

Welcome to the Minimal Java Machine Learning Toolkit — a lightweight, near dependency-free project offering basic tools for data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning using pure Java and only essential libraries like Apache Commons Math.

## Overview

The Minimal Java Machine Learning Toolkit is a minimal, easy-to-read codebase providing fundamental tools for working with data, performing basic statistical operations, and training simple machine learning models in Java. It is intended for:

- **Educational purposes**, helping learners understand algorithms without relying on black-box libraries
- **Constrained environments**, where installing large or unverified packages is not possible
- **Rapid prototyping**, using only Java’s standard features and trusted open-source utilities
- **Developers valuing portability, transparency, and simplicity**

No Weka. No DL4J. No complex frameworks. Just clean Java and essential math utilities.

## Features

The toolkit currently includes:

### Data Handling

- Read and parse CSV files (without external CSV libraries)
- Header detection, automatic type inference (int, double, String)
- Simple in-memory dataset representation using `List<Map<String, Object>>`

### Statistics & Preprocessing (with Apache Commons Math)

- Compute mean, variance, standard deviation, median
- Normalize/standardize features (Min-Max, Z-score)
- Encode categorical variables (label encoding)
- Handle missing values (drop, fill with default or average)

### Basic Machine Learning

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Train/test split and basic evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, MSE)

### Utilities

- File I/O helpers
- Simple progress messages (without third-party logging)
- Reproducibility via random seed setting


## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle (for dependency management)
- Go to https://github.com/aeliamomo/claude_test_scpG and install the rest

## Why This Project?

Many real-world and educational use cases need tools that are:

- **Portable**: Runs on any machine with Java
- **Transparent**: Logic is explicit, easy to follow and modify
- **Secure**: No unnecessary or untrusted external packages
- **Educational**: Helps users understand how things work under the hood

This project shows that even with minimal dependencies, Java is a capable tool for basic ML.
